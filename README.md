Data Cleaning: In this step we prepare the data for further analysis by removing null values, transforming and standardizing our data.

Exploratory Data Analyis: After cleaning process we study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on how they are related to each other.

Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model.

Evaluation: After model development we check the Confusion metrics and also checks for the accuracy which produces more accurate results.

# Tools & Technology Used :
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Python Libraries : Pnadas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.
Tableau Public

# Conclusion :
